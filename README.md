Image Enhancement Using Python
==================

Image Enhancement can be divided to **Two** class, the point processing and the histogram processing.

Point Processing
---------

Six methods are used here, they are:

Po
- Image Negative <br>
It's the simplest method to transform image using *point processing*
- Thresholding Transformations <br>
set a threshold function
- Logarithmic Transformations <br>
do the *Log* transformation to the image <br>
which can widen the image grey level
- Powers-Law Transformations <br>
Also be called the famous *Gamma transformation*
- Piecewise Linear Transformation Functions <br>
The *enhanced edition* of Thresholding Transformations

Histogram Processing
---------
Use histogram to process image.<br>
The most used method is called **histogram equalization**<br>
